1.Inconsistency in request message - Bad request
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 400 Bad Request response status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (for example, malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).
2.Forbidden request if file has different privileges
The HTTP 403 Forbidden response status code indicates that the server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.
3.The HTTP 404 Not Found response status code indicates that the server cannot find the requested resource. Links that lead to a 404 page are often called broken or dead links and can be subject to link rot.
4.Did not handle last-modified conditional header in request message 
5.Did not handle any case of bad request
6.Times out while sending file if file is large
7.My PUT request can also generate a new file (so uploading document / u can also replace a document but you can get a forbidden request error otherwise)
8.Works fine mostly if file small,certain types,no error in request
10.unecessary testing.txt being made 
11.can supply files only from current directory
12.AccessLog.txt being made after recv_request call,ideally should be before it
